# ðŸ§  Project Instructions for Copilot Agency

## ðŸ§± Architecture Overview

This project uses **Clean Architecture** with a **Feature-First** structure.

Each feature is self-contained with its own layers:

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ commons/               # Shared base utilities (e.g., base_cubit)
â”œâ”€â”€ constants/             # Static constants and keys
â”œâ”€â”€ core/                  # App-wide logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/               # Network configuration, clients
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ font/              # Font assets
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ localization/      # Localization setup
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routers/           # Global route setup
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/          # Shared services like SecureStorageService
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ theme/             # App-wide theme management
â”œâ”€â”€ features/              # All business logic is grouped per feature
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ <feature_name>/    # e.g., home_page/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ data/          # Data sources, models, repository impls
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ domain/        # Business logic (use cases, interfaces)
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ presentation/  # UI layer (Cubit/Bloc, Pages, Widgets)
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ <feature>_inject.dart  # DI setup for the feature
```

## ðŸ§­ Feature Structure Example

Example: `lib/features/home_page/`

```
home_page/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ repositories/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ home_page_repository.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ domain/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repositories/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useCases/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ get_home_page_use_case.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ presentation/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cubit/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mixins/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ screen/
â”œâ”€â”€ home_page_inject.dart
```



## ðŸ§ª Cubit/Bloc Usage
- Use Cubit or Bloc for state management in the presentation layer.
- Each feature should have its own Cubit/Bloc for managing state.
- All cubits should extend from a base class in `lib/commons/base_cubit.dart` for consistency.
- Use `getIt` for dependency injection in your Cubit/Bloc.
- Ensure that your Cubit/Bloc is easily testable by injecting dependencies.

## ðŸ¤– Copilot Agency Rules

- Always use **feature-based clean architecture**.
- Respect naming conventions and layer responsibilities.
- Do **not** put logic from `domain` inside `presentation` or `data` folders.
- When unsure, default to separation of concerns:  
  `data â†” domain â†” presentation`.
- Use `getIt` for dependency injection, ensuring features can be lazy-loaded if needed.
- When add new files, carefully follow the structure and naming conventions.
